# Guide to File Extensions

A list of the file types you may encounter in this project. We have attempted to restrict the software dependencies to free programs as much as possible, with a few exceptions (and we are working on those).

-  ```.sch``` [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/eagle-pcb-design-software/?language=en) circuit schematic
-  ```.brd``` [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/eagle-pcb-design-software/?language=en) printed circuit board file
-  ```.ods``` Open Document Spreadsheet file (supported by Excel, LibreOffice, etc.)
-  ```.stl``` 3D part file that can be used to send parts to a 3D printer or production service
-  ```.scad/escad``` [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org)/[extended OpenSCAD](http://www.implicitcad.org) code used to generate 3D part files
-  ```.part``` Proprietary [PTC Creo](http://www.ptc.com/product/creo/) CAD file. We try to provide open source equivalents to these files as much as possible, because CAD software can be very expensive.
-  ```.md ``` [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) file. Just a text file with standardized syntax for headings and things. 
-  ```.ino``` [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) program
-  ```.c/.h/.pde``` C source files for Arduino libraries
